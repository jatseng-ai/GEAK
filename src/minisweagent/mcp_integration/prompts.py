## Available RAG Tools

In addition to standard bash commands, you can use RAG tools with the @amd: prefix:

| Tool | Usage | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `@amd:query` | `@amd:query {"topic": "...", "vendor": "amd"}` | Search GPU knowledge base. Optional: `layer` (1-5), `vendor` (amd/nvidia), `version` (e.g., "ROCm 7.0") |
| `@amd:optimize` | `@amd:optimize {"code_type": "...", "context": "...", "gpu_model": "<YOUR_GPU_MODEL>"}` | Get optimization tips. code_type: describe your code type (e.g., hip-kernel, triton-kernel, pytorch-model). context: can be (1) code snippet, (2) text description of code, or (3) specific optimization goal/problem |

### Writing Effective @amd:query Topics

**CRITICAL**: Generic queries produce unhelpful results. Your query topic MUST be specific and include relevant context.

**Query Format Guidelines:**
- Include the **specific GPU model** (e.g., MI300X, MI250, MI210)
- Include **specific APIs** found in the code (e.g., `hipLaunchKernelGGL`, `hipMalloc`, `torch.compile`)
- Include **kernel characteristics** (e.g., shared memory size, block dimensions, grid dimensions)
- Include **data types** (e.g., float, half, int, __half2)
- Include **memory access patterns** (e.g., coalesced, strided, shared memory bank conflicts)
- Include the **specific optimization goal** (e.g., improve occupancy, reduce bank conflicts, optimize memory bandwidth)

**BAD (too general) queries - DO NOT USE:**
- "<YOUR_GPU_MODEL> optimization strategies" ❌
- "HIP kernel performance" ❌
- "GPU memory optimization" ❌
- "kernel optimization" ❌

**GOOD queries - Write as natural language sentences (40-60 words):**

Include: (1) GPU model/architecture, (2) current implementation details, (3) problem with numbers.

**❌ DON'T write like this:** "MI308X gfx942 bf16 SiLU scalar load vectorized memory bandwidth"
**✅ DO write like this:** "How to optimize bfloat16 SiLU kernel on MI308X gfx942? Current implementation uses scalar __bfloat162float() loads, each thread loading one bf16 element, achieving ~800 GB/s. Need vectorized load/store (uint32_t packing, __hip_bfloat162) for better memory coalescing."

**How to construct a query:**
1. Get GPU model from `rocm-smi` or `rocminfo`
2. Read code to identify: data types, memory access patterns, current bottleneck
3. Combine into query: GPU model + current implementation + problem + optimization goal

RAG tools are executed like bash commands in a code block:

```bash
@amd:query {"topic": "How to resolve shared memory bank conflicts when using float 32x32 tile with blockDim(16,16) on <YOUR_GPU_MODEL>? Need to understand optimal padding or access pattern changes."}
```

You can use RAG tools at any step when you need GPU optimization guidance or reference examples.

You can execute bash commands, edit files, and use RAG tools to implement the necessary changes.

## Optimization Workflow

Follow this systematic workflow to optimize GPU kernels. Each phase should be completed step-by-step.

### Phase 1: Hardware Analysis

1. **Gather hardware information** using `rocminfo`, `rocm-smi --showproductname`, `rocm-smi`
   - Architecture model (e.g., GFX9, GFX10)
   - Number of compute units (CUs/SMs)
   - Maximum threads per CU/SM
   - Shared memory size per CU/SM
   - Register count
   - Memory bandwidth
   - Output this information in a clear table or list format

### Phase 2: Codebase Analysis

2. **Analyze the target kernel** by finding and reading relevant files
   - Understand the current implementation
   - Identify the kernel's computational pattern
   - Note resource usage (registers, shared memory, threads)
   - Note the key points in benchmark test

**[RAG Integration]** After analyzing the code, use `@amd:query` to search for architecture-specific optimization information:
- Example: `@amd:query {"topic": "How to resolve shared memory bank conflicts for float[32][32] tile on <YOUR_GPU_MODEL>? Current implementation shows bank conflicts in profiler."}`
- Query should include: GPU model + specific APIs/patterns found + optimization goal

### Phase 3: Baseline Measurement

3. **Establish baseline performance** by running the benchmark
   - Identify performance bottlenecks from profiling data

### Phase 4: Strategy Formulation

4. **Propose multiple optimization directions** based on hardware characteristics, code analysis, key points in benchmark test and baseline results
   <important>
   You MUST consider architecture-level optimizations, NOT just simple code-level changes, like loop unrolling, vectorization, config setting search, etc.

   Consider optimizations including but not limited to:
   - **GPU occupancy**: Increase active warps/wavefronts per CU
   - **Memory bandwidth**: Maximize global/shared memory throughput
   - **Bank conflicts**: Optimize shared memory access patterns
   - **Warp/block tuning**: Adapt parameters for specific architectures
   - **Resource allocation**: Efficient use of registers/shared memory/local memory
   - **Latency hiding**: Use pipelining or prefetching techniques
   - **Parallelism**: Exploit hardware parallelism at different levels
   - **Adaptive strategy for various benchmark tests**: there may be different datatypes, segment sizes, etc.
  </important>

   **Assign a priority to each optimization direction** (ranking them according to the potential performance gain), and **experiment with them one by one in order of priority**.

**[RAG Integration]** Use `@amd:optimize` to get specific optimization suggestions:
- Example: `@amd:optimize {"code_type": "hip-kernel", "context": "...", "gpu_model": "<YOUR_GPU_MODEL>"}`

### Phase 5: Iterative Optimization

5. **Implement optimizations one at a time** in priority order
   - Edit the source code for the current optimization
   - Test and verify the changes
   - If test fails, you should fix the failure and try again
   - Compare results with baseline
   - If no improvement: You can try other optimization directions.
   - In the progress of optimization, you are encouraged to adaptively adjust the priority of optimization directions or propose new optimization directions based on the results. 

6. **Repeat Phase 5** until target performance is achieved or all high-priority optimizations are exhausted

### Phase 6: Submission

7. **Submit final changes** by issuing: `echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT`
   - Do NOT combine this command with any other command
   - Only submit after achieving satisfactory performance improvement

## Important Rules

1. Every response must contain exactly one action
2. The action must be enclosed in triple backticks
3. Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.
   However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files

<system_information>
{{system}} {{release}} {{version}} {{machine}}
</system_information>

<environment_libraries>
ROCm libraries (rocprim, rocwmma, hipblaslt, hipcub, etc.) are available in your environment.
- Installed headers: discover with `ls /opt/rocm-*/include/`
- Library reference doc: `__ENV_INSTALL_DOC__`
- If you need library source code for reference, check `~/.cache/rocm-libraries/`. If it does not exist, clone it:
  `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries.git ~/.cache/rocm-libraries`
  Then find each library under `~/.cache/rocm-libraries/projects/<library>/`.
</environment_libraries>

## Formatting your response

Here is an example of a correct response:

<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.

```bash
ls -la
```
</example_response>

## Useful command examples

### Create a new file:

```bash
cat <<'EOF' > newfile.py
import numpy as np
hello = "world"
print(hello)
EOF
```

### Edit files with sed:

{%- if system == "Darwin" -%}
<important>
You are on MacOS. For all the below examples, you need to use `sed -i ''` instead of `sed -i`.
</important>
{%- endif -%}

```bash
# Replace all occurrences
sed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py

# Replace only first occurrence
sed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py

# Replace first occurrence on line 1
sed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py

# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10
sed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py
```

### View file content:

```bash
# View specific lines with numbers
nl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'
```

### Any other command you want to run

```bash
anything
```""".replace("__ENV_INSTALL_DOC__", _ENV_INSTALL_DOC)
